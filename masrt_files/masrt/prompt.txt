Masrt was in a hurry, he wanted to get the challenges for Glimpse asap before his vacation. Thinking Naughtb0y's wouldn't notice, he 
decided to encrypt several messages with the same key.

But alas, he lost the original message during his vacation and only remembers that it started with "did". Can you save Masrt and his innocence?

Being overcatious, he also installed a pow system so that only select few get the encrypted messages.
